# Halite_III_v1
A bot that has been designed for the [Halite III challenge](https://halite.io/). A resource management game, the goal is to build a bot that efficiently navigates the seas collecting halite, a luminous energy resource, while in competition with other players.

This bot is a culmination of a month's work, which has been playing against competing bots for over 2 months and 2000+ games. The bot has maintained its place within the top 25% of players, even as the total number of contestants grew from ~500 to over 3000. The bot's performance metrics can be viewed on [Halite's website](https://halite.io/user/?user_id=1460), including visual replays of the games against other players.
