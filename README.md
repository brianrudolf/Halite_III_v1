# Halite_III_v1.0
A bot that has been designed for the [Halite III challenge](https://halite.io/). A resource management game, the goal is to build a bot that efficiently navigates the seas collecting halite, a luminous energy resource, while in competition with other players.

## 'The Professor' v1.0
The final bot (v1.0), playfully named 'The Professor', is a culmination of a month's work and has been competing against a rotating pool of bots for over 2 months and 2000+ games. The bot has maintained its place within the top 25% of players, even as the total number of contestants grew from ~500 to over 3000. The bot's performance metrics can be viewed on [Halite's website](https://halite.io/user/?user_id=1460), including visual replays of the games against other players.

This version of the bot utilized custom functions which mapped the amount of Halite (the game resource) on the sea floor, calculated the distance from each ship to the different locations on the map, and two navigation routines which were used to attempt optimize the movement of all of the ships in play.

## 'The Professor' v0.8
